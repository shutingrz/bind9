DESCRIPTION
===========

``dnssec-checkds`` verifies the correctness of Delegation Signer (DS)
resource records for keys in a specified zone.

OPTIONS
=======

-a algorithm
   Specify a digest algorithm to use when converting the zone's DNSKEY
   records to expected DS records. This option can be repeated, so that
   multiple records are checked for each DNSKEY record.

   The algorithm must be one of SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-384. These values
   are case insensitive, and the hyphen may be omitted. If no algorithm
   is specified, the default is SHA-256.

-f file
   If a ``file`` is specified, then the zone is read from that file to
   find the DNSKEY records. If not, then the DNSKEY records for the zone
   are looked up in the DNS.

-s file
   Specifies a prepared dsset file, such as would be generated by
   ``dnssec-signzone``, to use as a source for the DS RRset instead of
   querying the parent.

-d dig path
   Specifies a path to a ``dig`` binary. Used for testing.

-D dsfromkey path
   Specifies a path to a ``dnssec-dsfromkey`` binary. Used for testing.
